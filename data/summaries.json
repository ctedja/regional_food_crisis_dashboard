About 34 percent considered themselves as food-poor and 38 percent as borderline food-poor. Notably, the self-rated food poverty threshold rose to record-high in Mindanao, from 6,000 pesos to 9,500 pesos.","To monitor the impact of the global food, energy, and financial crisis, WFP has scaled up its monitoring and analysis activities in the Philippines.

The consequences on food security have been pronounced and sustained across the past few months; one-third of households are food insecure (32 percent in September), according to WFP\u2019s latest survey. These figures could still increase without immediate intervention. Multiple factors are colliding to amplify the pressure, from unfavourable harvests (the most recent rice harvest is 50 percent lower than normal) and widespread shortages of key imported commodities. Meanwhile, around seven in ten households are regularly turning to food-based coping strategies such as sacrificing meals, borrowing food, and reducing the number of meals eaten. Food prices remain high in the country and nearly 64 percent of households are consuming insufficient food and less diverse diets. Markets across the regions are also reporting volatility around prices and scarcity of essential items, as seen in the latest Market Functionality Index. ","WFP is responding to this crisis by scaling up operations to reach 3.4 million additional people in 2022. As of 7 November, WFP has reached around 490,000 people with cash-based transfers, in-kind food assistance, and school feeding support since commencing distributions. This includes reaching 2,490 pregnant women with value vouchers of LKR 15,000 (USD 40) each to support their food and nutritional needs. In partnership with the Government, WFP will support 1 million children aged 5 to 10 with school meals. WFP will prioritize vulnerable schools, where the Government\u2019s national school meals programme has been halted due to budget constraints. WFP has already supported 36,000 children through the government school meals programme.
