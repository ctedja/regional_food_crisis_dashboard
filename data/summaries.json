[["AFG","Afghanistan","Ripple effects from the crisis in Ukraine are deepening the food security crisis in Afghanistan, as the prices of basic food commodities, fuel, and agricultural inputs continue to surge. This adds to the repercussions of a severe drought, collapse of the economy and global price hikes that predate the conflict. The value of Afghani against the US Dollar depreciated by 33 percent compared to August 2021 and 25 percent compared to the two-year average. Severe cash shortages continue to limit economic activity within banks and local markets. \n<br><br>\nThe average price of WFP\u2019s basic food basket has been on an upward trend since March 2022, reaching AFN 8,531 (USD 95) in August. A 43.4 percent year-on-year inflation was recorded in September, with significantly higher prices for wheat flour, wheat grain and rice. ","Regional export bans continue to hinder WFP\u2019s ability to procure sufficient food commodities in a timely manner, with long lead times persisting for internationally procured commodities. This is particularly impacting WFP\u2019s plan to preposition 150,000 MT of food stock in areas likely to be inaccessible during winter. Meanwhile, the conflict in Ukraine also diverted attention and resources away from Afghanistan, as humanitarian operations in the country continued to face significant funding shortfalls. Funding constraints have already forced WFP to suspend programming for 8 million vulnerable people from June to September. <br><br>\nIn response, WFP implemented several mitigation measures, including diversifying its procurement sources and supply chain corridors, increasing local procurement where feasible, and negotiating for humanitarian exemptions for its exports from Central Asian countries and beyond.

If so, it will likely be even more difficult for them to implement food security initiatives without adequate staff support.","July","https:\/\/docs.wfp.org\/api\/documents\/WFP-0000142155\/download\/",2019,"https:\/\/docs.wfp.org\/api\/documents\/WFP-0000115217\/download\/?_ga=2.227552863.372404133.1623909993-1459795908.1619774406#:~:text=Fill%20the%20Nutrient%20Gap%20(FNG)%20is%20an%20analytical%20process%20to,of%20issues%2C%20contexts%20and%20solutions.",null,null,"Myanmar Data in Emergencies Monitoring Brief, round 3 (July 2022) ","https:\/\/data-in-emergencies.fao.org\/documents\/hqfao::myanmar-diem-monitoring-brief-round-3\/explore","USDA FAS Burma Rice Trade August bulletin","https:\/\/apps.fas.usda.gov\/newgainapi\/api\/Report\/DownloadReportByFileName?fileName=Rice+Trade+-+Monthly_Rangoon_Burma+-+Union+of_BM2022-0015.pdf","WFP-FAO survey data collection completed (August-September), results to be finalized by October","Country of Concern",96,22,3.0],["NPL","Nepal","While Nepal\u2019s direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine is limited, rising food and fuel prices, export bans, and supply chain limitations for cereals, vegetable oils and fertilizers could negatively impact food supply and ultimately push food even further out of reach for the most vulnerable people. <br><br>\nPrices of essential commodities remained relatively stable in August. However, the cost of a food basket is still 10 percent higher in August compared to that in April. Inflation increased by 8.26 percent year-on-year and 1.66 percent month-on-month.

Regional supply chain disruptions linked to the conflict in Ukraine resulted in persistently soaring food and fuel prices. This situation is exacerbated further by severe rains and widespread flooding in August, affecting 33 million people in 116 districts of seven provinces. Furthermore, crop losses and resulting food shortages will have a considerable impact on the overall food security situation. The need for food imports to cover these shortages is likely to increase, and thus global food prices are likely to have a greater impact on domestic food prices. The value of the Pakistani Rupee has already plunged \u2013 and is among the worst performing currencies globally. Headline inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is also at its highest rate in 47 years. \n<br><br>\nAn Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis was conducted in Pakistan in July across 28 vulnerable districts of Balochistan, KP, and Sindh provinces. It was found that around 5.96 million people (30 percent of the rural population) are estimated to be in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency) between July and November 2022. Key drivers of acute food insecurity include: a) high prices (food and non-food items) caused by the conflict in Ukraine; b) climatic conditions (drought conditions\/inadequate rainfall\/heatwave, monsoon rains\/flooding); c) reduced food production; and d) livestock diseases and deaths. ","Soaring food prices along with supply disruptions and food shortages caused by the recent monsoon flooding are likely to have an adverse impact on the value of WFP cash assistance and the cost of locally procured commodities. \n<br><br>\nWFP will continue to provide livelihoods and community stabilization assistance for highly vulnerable groups to complement government social safety net programmes. This will be done through cash assistance or food distributions, complemented by community-based participatory activities \u2013 particularly livelihoods and resilience-building support. Assistance will be provided to participants of community rehabilitation activities and capacity strengthening trainings (persons with disabilities and vulnerable individuals will receive unconditional cash support). \n<br><br>\nIn response to the flood emergency, WFP is rapidly scaling up its response to cover the needs of 1.9 million people from September 2022 to March 2023. WFP is also supporting the Government on its logistics capacity augmentation to help with storage, management, and dispatch of relief items. Beyond immediate needs, WFP plans to transition to recovery and resilience activities through early 2023 to help communities rehabilitate climate-smart infrastructure and restore livelihoods. ","The Government\u2019s Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) Kafalat social safety net programme currently covers 7.3 million people with a monthly stipend of PKR 2,000 per household, with a budget earmarked for 9 million people for 2022-2023. The current BISP beneficiaries will receive a monthly top-up of PKR 2,000 (USD 9.7) in light of the global food crisis. The Government announced a petrol and diesel subsidy of PKR 28 billion (USD 136 million) for vulnerable households earning less than PKR 40,000 a month. In response to the flood emergency, the Government is distributing a one-off cash payment of PKR 25,000 (USD 114) per household to the flood-affected families. In addition, the World Bank agreed to provide a contribution of USD 150 million, which is expected to cover those not currently registered under the BISP. \n<br><br>\nWFP continues its engagement with the National Socio-Economic Registry to incorporate the latest IPC information into targeting and programming for the BISP. This will maximize the prospects of inclusion for the most affected and vulnerable families for support, thereby circumventing a further deterioration in their food and nutrition security. In end-August, the Ministry of Finance announced the approval of a USD 1.17 billion bailout package from the IMF to avert near-term default. The fund will be key to stabilize the economy, in view of surging energy costs which eroded Pakistan\u2019s foreign-exchange reserves and the second-fastest inflation in Asia.","September","https:\/\/reliefweb.int\/report\/pakistan\/pakistan-market-monitor-report-september-2022",2019,"https:\/\/docs.wfp.org\/api\/documents\/WFP-0000107916\/download\/",null,null,"IPC AFI Analysis for Sindh, Balochistan and KP","https:\/\/wfp-my.sharepoint.com\/:b:\/g\/personal\/khadeeja_qasmi_wfp_org\/EW_LCc9QmV9Bo5jEOOZSsQYBvcKEaKyB7wY_I7niFIGGzw?e=q06EYb&download=1","Food inflation in Pakistan","https:\/\/wfp-my.sharepoint.com\/:b:\/g\/personal\/khadeeja_qasmi_wfp_org\/Ec-sl3mVjGZBr3xwqxBp_uoBt0wo52WSaRT_HrdUE0vtvA?e=giXpqr&download=1","Discussion is ongoing at CO level regarding high frequency monitoring.

Headline inflation reached 6.3 percent in July 2022, the highest recorded inflation since October 2018. The upwards trend is caused by the higher annual growth in food and non-alcoholic beverages. Prices of fuel continue to register net increases based on year-to-date data. Since the start of the year, a liter of gasoline, diesel and kerosene increased by 10 percent, 62 percent, and 65 percent respectively. Based on WFP\u2019s market monitoring in Typhoon Odette-affected provinces, 50 percent of the traders reported that customers continued buying less goods than usual and 25 percent mentioned that customers bought cheaper or less preferred goods in response to the surge in prices of goods. \n <br><br>\nThe rise in the overall cost of living and reduction in the affordability of basic commodities translates into more poor families in the country. The national Social Weather Survey of June 2022 found that 48 percent of Filipino families rated themselves as Poor (accounting for 12.2 million families), from 43 percent in April 2022. The survey also found that 74 percent of families feel Food-Poor (8.7 million) or Borderline Food-Poor (4.7 million).  ","To monitor the impact of the global food, energy and financial crisis, WFP has scaled up its monitoring and analysis activities in the Philippines. In June, WFP initiated bi-monthly market monitoring. WFP is collecting data in the Typhoon Odette-affected provinces of Bohol, Dinagat Islands, Southern Leyte, and Surigao del Norte. With support from the Joint SDG fund, WFP, FAO and ILO are also preparing to launch household phone surveys in the Philippines to support existing government monitoring and surveillance systems for agriculture, food security, and social protection.

Food prices continue to increase in the DPRK, with a 21 percent year-on-year increase recorded on rice prices. Corn prices were 52 percent higher than that in 2019, despite a slight year-on-year decrease seen in August. This is likely to reduce household purchasing power, particularly the ability of vulnerable households to afford a healthy diet and cover other essential needs. Fuel prices in August 2022 have tripled compared to the same time last year. The increased fuel prices are likely to impact DPRK\u2019s economic development, agricultural production and product transportation, which may reduce people\u2019s access to markets, especially in remote areas, and disrupt livelihoods. \n<br><br>\nThis could exacerbate DPRK\u2019s food security and nutrition situation, which is already concerning due to a lack of cultivable land surface, recurrent natural hazards, and a shortage of agricultural inputs. International borders have been closed since February 2020, resulting in the near suspension of food imports. This is likely to have been causing excessive consumption of national food reserves and posing potential threats to food security. DPRK imports fertilizers from China, where the high prices and tight market supply are likely to negatively impact the crop plantation and production in 2022.  ","WFP operations in DPRK are temporarily suspended and food purchases are on hold due to movement restrictions and prolonged border closures.
