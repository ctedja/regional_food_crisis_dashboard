WFP published the first round of the mVAM survey and presented the results to Government partners.","The Government continues to provide assistance to the hardest hit sectors and implements measures to boost agricultural productivity to ensure food security. The Government, through the Department of Social Welfare and Development implements the Targeted Cash Transfer Program to support 9.8 million beneficiaries with USD 50 to mitigate the impact of price increases to households in the next six months. The Department of Agriculture also implements the Kadiwa Program which connects producers to consumers, allowing a higher profit share for producers and affordable prices for consumers.

Year-on-year inflation throughout 2022 skyrocketed, to a peak of 70 percent in September. The consequences on food security have been pronounced and sustained; Over one-third of the population was food-insecure in November (37 percent). This has remained relatively stable for four months (32-37 percent). The proportion was particularly high in July (49 percent). Multiple factors are colliding to amplify the pressure, from unfavourable harvests (the most recent rice harvest was 50 percent lower than normal), high prices and shortages of key imported commodities. Markets across the regions are also reporting volatility around prices and scarcity of essential items, as seen in the latest Market Functionality Index. ","WFP is responding to this crisis by scaling up its operations to reach 3.4 million additional people in 2022. By end-2022, WFP had reached around 1.7 million people with cash-based transfers, in-kind food assistance, and school feeding support since commencing distributions in June. This includes reaching 2,490 pregnant women with value vouchers of LKR 15,000 (USD 40) each to support their food and nutritional needs.  WFP also piloted mobile shops in the district of Galle to support over 5,000 households. In partnership with the Government, WFP has achieved its plan to support 1 million children with school meals, and will continue its support to schoolchildren. WFP will also support the resumption of Sri Lanka\u2019s Thriposha nutrition programme that provides food fortified with vitamins and minerals to undernourished children under five and pregnant and lactating women.","The Government has requested assistance from the international community and UN agencies. The revised Humanitarian Needs and Priorities plan was launched to reach 3.4 million people from June to December 2022. Meanwhile the President called for a national plan ensuring food security and nutrition and welcomed all stakeholders to work collectively with the Government\u2019s new programme to address food shortages.\nThe budget for 2023 was presented in Parliament recently by the President, which introduced the concept of a \u201csocial market economy\u201d. Key highlights include LKR 500 million (USD 1.37 million) towards improving child nutrition and LKR 150 million (USD 410,000) for reducing post-harvest crop losses.

In response to the global food and fuel crisis, WFP ramped up its monitoring efforts through launching regular assessments on household food security levels and scaling up its market price monitoring of 15 markets country-wide (5 main markets and 10 minor markets) to bi-weekly data collection, to better understand the level of price volatility and access to food across Tajikistan.  WFP also collaborated with FAO and UNICEF to conduct the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) exercise.
