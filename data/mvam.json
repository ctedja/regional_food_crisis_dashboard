[["AFG","Afghanistan","Active","Monthly","Yes",null,null,"October","Afghanistan continues to face alarming levels of hunger. Month after month, some nine in ten households continue to face insufficient food consumption. The repercussions of the global food crisis are threatening to wreak further havoc on food security. Already pushed to their limit, families are spending nearly all of their income on food. Nearly half of the population is turning to drastic measures to put food on the table. \n<br><br>\nAmid persistent high food prices, average expenditure on food increased to 91 percent in July \u2014 a figure which has continually increased since January (80 percent). This leaves little left for other essential goods. While households across all divides are affected, female-headed households are especially vulnerable and are spending 95 percent of income on food, compared to 91 percent in male-headed households.","<span style='font-size:24px;color:#80bede'><i class='fas fa-wifi'><\/i>"],["BGD","Bangladesh","Active","Monthly","No",null,null,"September","In July 2022, 32 percent of the surveyed households were moderately food insecure, with less than one percent of households severely food insecure. Still, about half of the households applied crisis and emergency coping mechanisms (43 percent). This finding is alarming as applying negative coping mechanisms may have severe consequences for the future socialeconomic situation of the households.
