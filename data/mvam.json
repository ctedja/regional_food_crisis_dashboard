Insufficient food consumption had already spiked to 75 percent in August 2020, at the first peak of the pandemic. But when this couldn\u2019t seem to have gotten worse, a combination of drought, conflict, political instability, and the economic crisis collided to deepen the food security crisis. By August 2022, Afghanistan had topped the list of countries with insufficient food consumption.
