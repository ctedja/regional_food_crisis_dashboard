This adds to the repercussions of a severe drought, collapse of the economy and global price hikes that predate the conflict. The value of Afghani against the US Dollar depreciated by 33 percent compared to August 2021 and 25 percent compared to the two-year average. Severe cash shortages continue to limit economic activity within banks and local markets. \n<br><br>\nThe average price of WFP\u2019s basic food basket has been on an upward trend since March 2022, reaching AFN 8,531 (USD 95) in August. A 43.4 percent year-on-year inflation was recorded in September, with significantly higher prices for wheat flour, wheat grain and rice. ", "Regional export bans continue to hinder WFP\u2019s ability to procure sufficient food commodities in a timely manner, with long lead times persisting for internationally procured commodities. This is particularly impacting WFP\u2019s plan to preposition 150,000 MT of food stock in areas likely to be inaccessible during winter. Meanwhile, the conflict in Ukraine also diverted attention and resources away from Afghanistan, as humanitarian operations in the country continued to face significant funding shortfalls. Funding constraints have already forced WFP to suspend programming for 8 million vulnerable people from June to September. <br><br>\nIn response, WFP implemented several mitigation measures, including diversifying its procurement sources and supply chain corridors, increasing local procurement where feasible, and negotiating for humanitarian exemptions for its exports from Central Asian countries and beyond. Moreover, WFP is regularly monitoring the suppliers for any potential delivery delays and cancellations.

GDP growth is projected to fall to 5.1 percent in 2022 from 8.2 percent in 2019 and the average income of the poor has fallen 23 percent below the pre-COVID level. The country was the third major export market for both Russian and Ukrainian wheat in 2020-21, and was already facing creeping inflation even before the conflict in Ukraine. Unusual weather conditions and increased fertilizer prices may severely affect the upcoming agricultural season. In addition, countrywide electricity rationing (load-shedding), fuel price increases, the foreign exchange crisis and unstable dollar rates, are seriously impacting the economy.  \n<br><br>\nThe latest WFP food security monitoring surveys indicated that 22 percent of the surveyed households were moderately food insecure. Food-based and livelihood coping mechanisms continue to be applied, which has led to poor nutrient uptake, especially heme iron, among low and medium-income households hardest hit by the shocks.", "WFP is exploring various solutions to protect refugees\u2019 purchasing power under the general food assistance programme: \n1) Increase CBT transfer value, where possible; \n2) Direct distribution of at-risk item(s) (e.g., 1L of oil per person per month); \n3) Maintain the same prices for refugees at outlet-level, but WFP to pay the market price difference to retailers directly; \n4) Increase market research capacity to forecast at-risk items in advance (where possible) to provide more lead time to temporarily switch to in-kind, where necessary; \n5) Assess the viability of alternative commodities to at-risk items, while maintaining nutritional value. \n<br>\nFor nutrition programmes, the rising cost of wheat will likely increase the cost of WSB+\/WSB++ and will require WFP to either reduce the ration size or reduce the number of participants, unless additional funding is secured.

This situation is exacerbated further by severe rains and widespread flooding in August, affecting 33 million people in 116 districts of seven provinces. Furthermore, crop losses and resulting food shortages will have a considerable impact on the overall food security situation. The need for food imports to cover these shortages is likely to increase, and thus global food prices are likely to have a greater impact on domestic food prices.

It was found that around 5.96 million people (30 percent of the rural population) are estimated to be in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency) between July and November 2022. Key drivers of acute food insecurity include: a) high prices (food and non-food items) caused by the conflict in Ukraine; b) climatic conditions (drought conditions\/inadequate rainfall\/heatwave, monsoon rains\/flooding); c) reduced food production; and d) livestock diseases and deaths.

This situation is exacerbated further by severe rains and widespread flooding in August, affecting 33 million people in 116 districts of seven provinces. Furthermore, crop losses and resulting food shortages will have a considerable impact on the overall food security situation. The need for food imports to cover these shortages is likely to increase, and thus global food prices are likely to have a greater impact on domestic food prices.

It was found that around 5.96 million people (30 percent of the rural population) are estimated to be in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency) between July and November 2022. Key drivers of acute food insecurity include: a) high prices (food and non-food items) caused by the conflict in Ukraine; b) climatic conditions (drought conditions\/inadequate rainfall\/heatwave, monsoon rains\/flooding); c) reduced food production; and d) livestock diseases and deaths.
