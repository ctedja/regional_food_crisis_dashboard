                "Ripple effects from the crisis in Ukraine are deepening the food security crisis in Afghanistan, as the prices of basic food commodities, fuel, and agricultural inputs continue to surge. The price of wheat flour has increased by 24 percent since October 2021, while vegetable oil increased by 41 percent since March 2022 alone. In June, the average national price of WFP\u2019s basic food basket increased by 6 percent, compared to the previous month. However, price increases varied across the country, with the highest increase of 19 percent recorded in Farah province. ",
                "The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has resulted in regional export bans that continue to hinder WFP\u2019s ability to efficiently procure sufficient food commodities in a timely manner. In June, supply of wheat to Afghan markets dropped by 49 percent, compared to the previous month, mainly due to export restrictions from Kazakhstan, which acts as the primary supplier of wheat to the country. Kazakhstan\u2019s recent extension of export restrictions through September 2022 indicates that supply challenges for staple food commodities in Afghanistan will continue into the second half of 2022. Due to the impact of the war in Ukraine on global supply chains, WFP continues to struggle with long lead times for the delivery of international procured commodities to Afghanistan. This is particularly pertinent to WFP\u2019s ability to preposition 150,000 MT of food stock before November 2022, ahead of the 2023 winter season. \n<br><br>\nSteep and steady increases in fuel prices continue to impact WFP operations, as overall procurement costs have increased in line with food transport costs. Rising operational costs continue to negatively impact WFP Afghanistan\u2019s resourcing outlook for the remainder of the year. Due to the impact of the crisis in Ukraine on global food and fuel prices, WFP requires an additional USD 250 million for food and transport in 2022. \n<br><br>\nFurthermore, WFP now requires an additional USD 45 million for cash-based transfers, due to an increase in transfer values, necessitated by rising food prices and inflation. Overall, the cost of WFP\u2019s commodity voucher food basket has increased by more than 17 percent since December 2021 and 37 percent compared to April 2021. From June to December, the average increase in operational needs will increase by approximately 19 percent.",

On 13 May, India then banned domestic exports of wheat and onion seeds, which \u2013 on top of the conflict \u2013 have sent local market prices spiralling upwards in Cox\u2019s Bazar. Before Indonesia temporarily banned the export of palm oil, 80 percent of Bangladeshi palm oil imports were sourced from Indonesia. \n<br><br>\nThe annual inflation rate in Bangladesh shot up to 7.56 percent in June of  2022 from 7.42 percent in the previous month. It was the highest inflation rate since July of 2013 underpinned by soaring prices of food (8.37 percent vs 8.30 percent in May). Refugees already spend an average of 52 percent of their e-voucher entitlement on rice. If their current purchasing power is not maintained, WFP expects to see refugees spend a higher proportion of their entitlement on energy-dense cereals to minimize food costs, as opposed to micronutrient-rich fresh fruits, vegetables, and animal proteins. ",
                "Inflation in Bangladesh in June rose to 7.56 per cent\u2014the highest in eight years. Adjusting the existing food monthly expenditure basket (MEB) for the April rate of inflation means an increase from USD 15.50 per person (established in November 2020) to USD 16.67per person. The rising cost of wheat will likely increase the cost of WSB+\/WSB++ and will require WFP to either reduce the ration size or reduce the number of participants in its nutrition programmes, unless additional donor support is secured. In May 2022, WFP had to abruptly provide a mid-month top-up to refugee households in the camps, due to a sudden nation-wide price hike in vegetable oil.\n<br><br>\nWFP is exploring the deployment of various solutions (individually or in parallel) to protect refugees\u2019 purchasing power in Cox\u2019s Bazar as much as possible, including: 1) Increase transfer value, where possible; 2) Deduct at-risk item(s) from value voucher and distribute directly to refugees (e.g., 1L of oil per person per month); 3) Maintain the same prices for refugees at outlet-level, but WFP to pay the market price difference to retailers directly; 4) Increase market research capacity to forecast at-risk items in advance (where possible) to provide more lead time to temporarily switch to in-kind, where necessary; 5) Assess the viability of alternative commodities to at-risk items, while maintaining nutritional value.",
                "To support the poor and vulnerable, the Government has increased the selling of essential commodities at a reduced price in addition to open market sales of rice. The Government sought a USD 4.5 billion loan from IMF to cope with mounting economic pressure (and for balance of payment and budgetary needs). The Government provided 28 stimulus packages equivalent to USD 23 billion (6.3 percent of GDP). A total of 67.4 million people and 118,000 business entities benefited from these packages",

When comparing the third week of February with the fourth week of July, the price of domestic wheat flour recorded a 12 percent weekly increase. Despite this, the knock-on effects of the conflict in Ukraine on Indonesia have been minimal to date, as Indonesia has substituted wheat imports from Ukraine. In June, Indonesia doubled its imports from Australia and has also started importing wheat from other countries including Argentina, Thailand, Pakistan, and Myanmar.

                "The conflict is exacerbating existing stresses following the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which had already eroded the resilience of the most vulnerable households. Rising food prices and inflation are negatively affecting the ability of the poorest households, who already spend more than half of their budget on food, to access a nutritious diet. Poverty has skyrocketed from 20 percent in 2019 to 33 percent in 2021, with an additional 10 percent at risk of poverty. Extreme (food) poverty reached 6 percent in 2021 from 0.5 percent in 2019. Thus, two decades of development gains had been lost in just the two years before the current Global Food Crisis. Overall, the situation remains highly volatile as many unknowns remain on future developments.\n<br><br>\nIn June 2022, inflation remained high at 13.1 percent compared with June 2021, the highest in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries, and food inflation for staple commodities is nearing 20 percent (Jan-Jun 2022 compared with the same period last year). While fuel prices appeared to remain somewhat constant between February 2022 to June 2022, they remain over 60 percent higher than in February 2020. The Kyrgyz Republic does not produce mineral fertilizers and it imports it from Uzbekistan, the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Rising input costs (e.g., fertilizers) could impact next season\u2019s harvest, leading to elevated food prices in the longer run. Moreover, the Kyrgyz Republic has a high dependency on imports: 30 percent for wheat, 84 percent for vegetable oil and 37 percent for sugar. Out of the imported wheat, vegetable oil and sugar, 95 percent, 81 percent and 99 percent respectively comes from the Russian Federation. The high dependency on Russian imports exposes the country to increased vulnerability to shocks and volatility.\n<br><br>\nAdditionally, the Kyrgyz economy is highly dependent on remittances, which made up 31 percent of the country\u2019s economy (GDP) in 2020 and has been an important contributor to reducing the national poverty rate: without remittances, poverty would have reached 43 percent  and extreme poverty would have reached 17 percent in 2021. Remittances from the Russian Federation make up 80 percent of all remittances to the country. Due to the recent sanctions on the Russian Federation, a drop of 33 percent in remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic is predicted for 2022 (World Bank). Poverty may reach 38 percent at the end of 2022 (World Bank Estimate) due to the current crisis, increasing the already high social protection caseload. The proportion of the population who are food insecure is likely to be much higher, since those below the poverty line cannot afford a nutrient adequate diet.",

                "While Nepal\u2019s direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine is largely limited, rising food and fuel prices, export bans, and supply chain limitations for cereals, vegetable oils and fertilizers could negatively impact food supply and ultimately push food even further out of reach for the most vulnerable people. \n<br><br>\nIn June 2022, compared to the previous year, prices of essential commodities showed an upward trend, increasing pressure on vulnerable households. Prices of edible oil, wheat flour and pulses increased sharply. The inflation rate rose to 8.56 percent in June 2022, year-on-year. Overall, the increases can be largely explained by the impact of the conflict in Ukraine on Nepal\u2019s retail markets, the shortage of some food commodities, and the increase in fuel prices and transportation costs. Supply and transportation of goods to markets remained stable; however, an increase in transportation costs has been observed in all surveyed districts. Export bans imposed by India, including on wheat and sugar, are also increasing prices and having knock-on effects, for example on the cost of poultry and eggs. The early and above average 2022 monsoon season will also likely contribute to increased food insecurity along with rising prices.",
                "Immediate impacts on WFP operations will include delays in procurement and increases in the cost of operations, constraining WFP\u2019s ability to respond.

Soaring food and fuel prices are being further impacted by regional supply chain disruptions linked to the conflict in Ukraine. TIn 2022, the Pakistan rupees value decreased by 32 percent, classifying it as the second worst performing currency in the world (ranking below the Sri Lankan currency whose value decreased 78.4 percent this year) According to Arif Habib securities, the US dollar has increased 12.06 percent in value relative to the Pakistani rupee in July alone. The resultant economic impact is hitting the poorest segments of the economy the most. Headline inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased in May 2022 by 13.76 percent over May 2021. CPI food inflation in May 2022 increased by 17.3 percent over May 2021. (Further information is available in the Market Monitor Report for June 2022). \n<br><br>\nAccording to the results of the Comprehensive Food Security and Livelihood Assessment (CFSLA) in the newly merged areas of KP, overall 35 percent of the households are experiencing food insecurity. Of these, 31 percent are moderately food insecure while 4 percent are severely food insecure. \n<br><br>\nExperts fear that the country\u2019s wheat production may fall short of the 30 million tonnes required. As yet, the outlook provided by the Ministry of Agriculture remains positive, indicating nearly adequate availability of food to meet the country\u2019s need. However, against a backdrop of high levels of food security and undernutrition, weak food systems, high likelihood of flooding due to the ongoing monsoon season (as there have been localized instances of flooding, and resultant infrastructure damage at several locations across the country already) and significant disparities in the access and availability of food, there are serious concerns, particularly for poor and marginalized population groups.",

Rising food prices have also devalued cash disbursements being made under WFP\u2019s CBT programmes. The cost of WFP\u2019s food basket has also increased by 30 percent since January 2022.\n<br><br>\nWhile WFP in Pakistan rarely needs to import wheat internationally for its operations, the expected shortage could lead to a need for further wheat imports. The substantial hike in global wheat prices could have implications for WFP\u2019s food basket in Pakistan as well.\n<br><br>\nTo complement and support government social safety net programmes WFP will continue to provide livelihoods and community stabilization assistance for extremely vulnerable groups whose conditions are exacerbated by the adverse effect of soaring prices and a fragile socio-economic environment. This will be through cash or food distributions, complemented by community-based participatory activities \u2013 particularly livelihoods and resilience-building support. Assistance will be provided to participants of community rehabilitation activities and capacity strengthening trainings (persons with disabilities and other extremely vulnerable individuals will receive unconditional cash support).

                "The BISP Kafalat social safety net programme of the Government of Pakistan currently covers 7.3 million people with a monthly stipend of PKR 2,000 per household. The monthly transfer amount was increased in March 2022. The target group is steadily increasing; at the end of 2021 the programme covered 5.7 million beneficiaries, a figure that has now increased to 7.3 million, and the Government has earmarked budget for 9 million people for 2022-2023. To further protect against the fuel price hikes, the Government has announced a petrol and diesel subsidy of PKR 28 billion (US$ 136 million) in the fiscal budget 2022-23 for those vulnerable households earning less than PKR 40,000 a month. The current BISP beneficiaries of the Kafalat programme (7.3 million) would automatically receive this top-up amount of PKR 2,000 (US$ 9.7) each month under this support. \n<br><br>\nIn order to protect current development gains and prevent more people from being pushed into chronic food insecurity status, WFP is continuing engagement with the National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER) to incorporate the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) information into targeting and programming for the BISP.

Kazakhstan\u2019s recent extension of export restrictions through September 2022 indicates that supply challenges for staple food commodities in Afghanistan will continue into the second half of 2022.

On 13 May, India then banned domestic exports of wheat and onion seeds, which \u2013 on top of the conflict \u2013 have sent local market prices spiralling upwards in Cox\u2019s Bazar.

Refugees already spend an average of 52 percent of their e-voucher entitlement on rice.

The rising cost of wheat will likely increase the cost of WSB+\/WSB++ and will require WFP to either reduce the ration size or reduce the number of participants in its nutrition programmes, unless additional donor support is secured. In May 2022, WFP had to abruptly provide a mid-month top-up to refugee households in the camps, due to a sudden nation-wide price hike in vegetable oil.\n<br><br>\nWFP is exploring the deployment of various solutions (individually or in parallel) to protect refugees\u2019 purchasing power in Cox\u2019s Bazar as much as possible, including: 1) Increase transfer value, where possible; 2) Deduct at-risk item(s) from value voucher and distribute directly to refugees (e.g., 1L of oil per person per month); 3) Maintain the same prices for refugees at outlet-level, but WFP to pay the market price difference to retailers directly; 4) Increase market research capacity to forecast at-risk items in advance (where possible) to provide more lead time to temporarily switch to in-kind, where necessary; 5) Assess the viability of alternative commodities to at-risk items, while maintaining nutritional value.",

                "The conflict is exacerbating existing stresses following the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which had already eroded the resilience of the most vulnerable households. Rising food prices and inflation are negatively affecting the ability of the poorest households, who already spend more than half of their budget on food, to access a nutritious diet. Poverty has skyrocketed from 20 percent in 2019 to 33 percent in 2021, with an additional 10 percent at risk of poverty. Extreme (food) poverty reached 6 percent in 2021 from 0.5 percent in 2019. Thus, two decades of development gains had been lost in just the two years before the current Global Food Crisis. Overall, the situation remains highly volatile as many unknowns remain on future developments.\n<br><br>\nIn June 2022, inflation remained high at 13.1 percent compared with June 2021, the highest in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries, and food inflation for staple commodities is nearing 20 percent (Jan-Jun 2022 compared with the same period last year). While fuel prices appeared to remain somewhat constant between February 2022 to June 2022, they remain over 60 percent higher than in February 2020. The Kyrgyz Republic does not produce mineral fertilizers and it imports it from Uzbekistan, the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Rising input costs (e.g., fertilizers) could impact next season\u2019s harvest, leading to elevated food prices in the longer run. Moreover, the Kyrgyz Republic has a high dependency on imports: 30 percent for wheat, 84 percent for vegetable oil and 37 percent for sugar. Out of the imported wheat, vegetable oil and sugar, 95 percent, 81 percent and 99 percent respectively comes from the Russian Federation. The high dependency on Russian imports exposes the country to increased vulnerability to shocks and volatility.\n<br><br>\nAdditionally, the Kyrgyz economy is highly dependent on remittances, which made up 31 percent of the country\u2019s economy (GDP) in 2020 and has been an important contributor to reducing the national poverty rate: without remittances, poverty would have reached 43 percent  and extreme poverty would have reached 17 percent in 2021. Remittances from the Russian Federation make up 80 percent of all remittances to the country. Due to the recent sanctions on the Russian Federation, a drop of 33 percent in remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic is predicted for 2022 (World Bank). Poverty may reach 38 percent at the end of 2022 (World Bank Estimate) due to the current crisis, increasing the already high social protection caseload. The proportion of the population who are food insecure is likely to be much higher, since those below the poverty line cannot afford a nutrient adequate diet.",
                "WFP is preparing to expand its beneficiary base as the food security situation worsens. WFP will review the Government\u2019s targeting criteria, implement a joint targeting exercise, and provide its unconditional cash transfer to the most vulnerable, including the urban poor.\n<br><br>\nWFP is exploring options to mitigate the increased cost of programme implementation. Under the Optimisation of the School Meals Programme (Outcome 1), this may include increasing advocacy for government contributions to be adjusted against inflation or another index (i.e., indexation of contributions) and formalizing parental contributions. \n<br><br>\nThe country office, in collaboration with UNDP, FAO and UNICEF, will conduct a household survey on the impact of the crisis on households to assess their food security and resilience among others. WFP will continue regular market price monitoring for key commodities and, from August 2022, household primary data collection (mVAM) to assess the vulnerability and food security impact of the crisis.\n<br><br>\nUnder WFP\u2019s food assistance for assets and food assistance for training activities, WFP is prioritizing assets and trainings with clear and direct linkages to improved food security. WFP will also review its transfer entitlements through conditional transfer such as FFA and FFT, based on the situation. Improvement of agricultural infrastructure, resilient food systems, creating income opportunities, and vocational training will be enhanced. Local food production, its processing and value-added supply chain will be enhanced.\n<br><br>\nWFP also provided policy and technical support to replicate the piloted Social Contract nationwide, and is supporting the Government to develop a policy framework for the \u201cMeken Chakyrygy\u201d public works programme of the state anti-crises plan.

In addition, during this period households are likely to experience some deterioration\n in their diets and food security that is normally associated with the lean season.  This has serious implications on the food security situation of some households because of the weak purchasing power, poor availability of imported goods, and stagnant salaries for civil servants. In addition, the record depreciation of the Lao Kip against the US dollar and the Thai baht are exacerbating inflation levels in Lao PDR and exposing some households to weak purchasing power, ultimately impacting the quality and quantity of households\u2019 diets. Such conditions have left about 65 percent of households experiencing some level of food insecurity (FIES) during the period of April-May according to a World Bank assessment that was conducted in April-May. \n<br><br>\nAccording to the Bank of Lao PDR, Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Lao PDR increased to 144.50 points in June from 131.30 points in May of 2022. With 2016 being the base year where a 100% CPI was reached.  The rise in the CPI is a sign that consumer prices are also increasing.

Should the situation deteriorate and there arise a need for emergency food assistance, the country office has secured in-kind and cash-based transfers to respond to possible shocks\/disasters. This includes 1,700 MT of in-kind rice which could provide temporary relief to approximately 20,000-25,000 beneficiaries in 2022-2023, plus a high probability of an additional 1,300 MT of rice for 2023-2024.

The Cluster has advised partners to expect an increase in costs of up to 40 percent and to budget accordingly. Cluster leads are also concerned that rising costs will increase activity support costs, which will require budget adjustments that may have a negative impact on the number of beneficiaries reached in 2022. Further, with the Humanitarian Response Plan critically underfunded in 2022, Cluster partners may have to reduce staff numbers.

Multiple factors are colliding to amplify the pressure, from unfavourable harvests (the most recent rice harvest is 50 percent lower than normal) and widespread shortages of key imported commodities (200 essential medicines are out of stock and fuel stocks have prompted closures\/suspension of schools and some government offices) to extremely volatile prices.

Rising food prices and inflation are negatively affecting the ability of the poorest households, who already spend more than half of their budget on food, to access a nutritious diet. Poverty has skyrocketed from 20 percent in 2019 to 33 percent in 2021, with an additional 10 percent at risk of poverty. Extreme (food) poverty reached 6 percent in 2021 from 0.5 percent in 2019. Thus, two decades of development gains had been lost in just the two years before the current Global Food Crisis. Overall, the situation remains highly volatile as many unknowns remain on future developments.\n<br><br>\nIn June 2022, inflation remained high at 13.1 percent compared with June 2021, the highest in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries, and food inflation for staple commodities is nearing 20 percent (Jan-Jun 2022 compared with the same period last year). While fuel prices appeared to remain somewhat constant between February 2022 to June 2022, they remain over 60 percent higher than in February 2020. The Kyrgyz Republic does not produce mineral fertilizers and it imports it from Uzbekistan, the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Rising input costs (e.g., fertilizers) could impact next season\u2019s harvest, leading to elevated food prices in the longer run. Moreover, the Kyrgyz Republic has a high dependency on imports: 30 percent for wheat, 84 percent for vegetable oil and 37 percent for sugar. Out of the imported wheat, vegetable oil and sugar, 95 percent, 81 percent and 99 percent respectively comes from the Russian Federation. The high dependency on Russian imports exposes the country to increased vulnerability to shocks and volatility.\n<br><br>\nAdditionally, the Kyrgyz economy is highly dependent on remittances, which made up 31 percent of the country\u2019s economy (GDP) in 2020 and has been an important contributor to reducing the national poverty rate: without remittances, poverty would have reached 43 percent  and extreme poverty would have reached 17 percent in 2021. Remittances from the Russian Federation make up 80 percent of all remittances to the country. Due to the recent sanctions on the Russian Federation, a drop of 33 percent in remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic is predicted for 2022 (World Bank). Poverty may reach 38 percent at the end of 2022 (World Bank Estimate) due to the current crisis, increasing the already high social protection caseload. The proportion of the population who are food insecure is likely to be much higher, since those below the poverty line cannot afford a nutrient adequate diet.",

The increase in fuel prices has caused transport costs to rise \u2013 a key driver of increasing retail food prices. The cost of a basic food basket has increased by 35 percent compared to one year ago, with edible oils doubling (+110 percent), and retail fuel prices are up (112-118 percent for gasoline \/ 161-164 percent for diesel). Rising fertilizer prices could drive food prices higher still; while Myanmar mainly imports fertilizer from China, the conflict in Ukraine is expected to have knock-on effects on the availability and price of fertilizer in Myanmar.",

These may include adjusting transport contracts and increasing the value of cash-based transfers to meet the basic needs of beneficiaries. WFP also continues to allow more lead time for the procurement of food and nutrition rations. A potential risk of rising prices is that WFP will need to procure rice and other commodities from international markets at a higher cost. This would require additional funding or reducing relief assistance coverage.",

Their research shows that in Myanmar it is difficult to separate the impact of the Ukraine conflict from the ongoing impacts of the military takeover in February 2021 and lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cluster has advised partners to expect an increase in costs of up to 40 percent and to budget accordingly. Cluster leads are also concerned that rising costs will increase activity support costs, which will require budget adjustments that may have a negative impact on the number of beneficiaries reached in 2022. Further, with the Humanitarian Response Plan critically underfunded in 2022, Cluster partners may have to reduce staff numbers.

Prices of edible oil, wheat flour and pulses increased sharply. The inflation rate rose to 8.56 percent in June 2022, year-on-year. Overall, the increases can be largely explained by the impact of the conflict in Ukraine on Nepal\u2019s retail markets, the shortage of some food commodities, and the increase in fuel prices and transportation costs. Supply and transportation of goods to markets remained stable; however, an increase in transportation costs has been observed in all surveyed districts.

However, against a backdrop of high levels of food security and undernutrition, weak food systems, high likelihood of flooding due to the ongoing monsoon season (as there have been localized instances of flooding, and resultant infrastructure damage at several locations across the country already) and significant disparities in the access and availability of food, there are serious concerns, particularly for poor and marginalized population groups.",

Rising food prices have also devalued cash disbursements being made under WFP\u2019s CBT programmes. The cost of WFP\u2019s food basket has also increased by 30 percent since January 2022.\n<br><br>\nWhile WFP in Pakistan rarely needs to import wheat internationally for its operations, the expected shortage could lead to a need for further wheat imports. The substantial hike in global wheat prices could have implications for WFP\u2019s food basket in Pakistan as well.\n<br><br>\nTo complement and support government social safety net programmes WFP will continue to provide livelihoods and community stabilization assistance for extremely vulnerable groups whose conditions are exacerbated by the adverse effect of soaring prices and a fragile socio-economic environment. This will be through cash or food distributions, complemented by community-based participatory activities \u2013 particularly livelihoods and resilience-building support. Assistance will be provided to participants of community rehabilitation activities and capacity strengthening trainings (persons with disabilities and other extremely vulnerable individuals will receive unconditional cash support).

The target group is steadily increasing; at the end of 2021 the programme covered 5.7 million beneficiaries, a figure that has now increased to 7.3 million, and the Government has earmarked budget for 9 million people for 2022-2023. To further protect against the fuel price hikes, the Government has announced a petrol and diesel subsidy of PKR 28 billion (US$ 136 million) in the fiscal budget 2022-23 for those vulnerable households earning less than PKR 40,000 a month. The current BISP beneficiaries of the Kafalat programme (7.3 million) would automatically receive this top-up amount of PKR 2,000 (US$ 9.7) each month under this support. \n<br><br>\nIn order to protect current development gains and prevent more people from being pushed into chronic food insecurity status, WFP is continuing engagement with the National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER) to incorporate the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) information into targeting and programming for the BISP.

June\u2019s figure shows an increase from the 3.55 percent recorded in May and is exceeding the 4 percent target set by the Government but remains lower than the rest of the world \u2013 indicating overall good economic performance so far, according to the International Monetary Fund. The rise in inflation was mainly triggered by volatile prices of food commodities including chilli, bird\u2019s eye chilli, shallot, and chicken egg. The increase in domestic prices was mainly caused by crop failures due to a rainfall anomaly. \n<br><br>\nThe domestic price of wheat flour in Indonesia has recorded a consistent increase since the start of the conflict in Ukraine. When comparing the third week of February with the fourth week of July, the price of domestic wheat flour recorded a 12 percent weekly increase. Despite this, the knock-on effects of the conflict in Ukraine on Indonesia have been minimal to date, as Indonesia has substituted wheat imports from Ukraine. In June, Indonesia doubled its imports from Australia and has also started importing wheat from other countries including Argentina, Thailand, Pakistan, and Myanmar. Moreover, on the domestic market, imports of wheat are used for the wheat flour industry, instant noodles, bread, and cattle feed which are not considered staple commodities in Indonesia. ",

                "The conflict is exacerbating existing stresses following the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which had already eroded the resilience of the most vulnerable households. Rising food prices and inflation are negatively affecting the ability of the poorest households, who already spend more than half of their budget on food, to access a nutritious diet. Poverty has skyrocketed from 20 percent in 2019 to 33 percent in 2021, with an additional 10 percent at risk of poverty. Extreme (food) poverty reached 6 percent in 2021 from 0.5 percent in 2019. Thus, two decades of development gains had been lost in just the two years before the current Global Food Crisis. Overall, the situation remains highly volatile as many unknowns remain on future developments.\n<br><br>\nIn June 2022, inflation remained high at 13.1 percent compared with June 2021, the highest in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries, and food inflation for staple commodities is nearing 20 percent (Jan-Jun 2022 compared with the same period last year). While fuel prices appeared to remain somewhat constant between February 2022 to June 2022, they remain over 60 percent higher than in February 2020. The Kyrgyz Republic does not produce mineral fertilizers and it imports it from Uzbekistan, the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Rising input costs (e.g., fertilizers) could impact next season\u2019s harvest, leading to elevated food prices in the longer run. Moreover, the Kyrgyz Republic has a high dependency on imports: 30 percent for wheat, 84 percent for vegetable oil and 37 percent for sugar. Out of the imported wheat, vegetable oil and sugar, 95 percent, 81 percent and 99 percent respectively comes from the Russian Federation. The high dependency on Russian imports exposes the country to increased vulnerability to shocks and volatility.\n<br><br>\nAdditionally, the Kyrgyz economy is highly dependent on remittances, which made up 31 percent of the country\u2019s economy (GDP) in 2020 and has been an important contributor to reducing the national poverty rate: without remittances, poverty would have reached 43 percent  and extreme poverty would have reached 17 percent in 2021. Remittances from the Russian Federation make up 80 percent of all remittances to the country. Due to the recent sanctions on the Russian Federation, a drop of 33 percent in remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic is predicted for 2022 (World Bank). Poverty may reach 38 percent at the end of 2022 (World Bank Estimate) due to the current crisis, increasing the already high social protection caseload. The proportion of the population who are food insecure is likely to be much higher, since those below the poverty line cannot afford a nutrient adequate diet.",

This has serious implications on the food security situation of some households because of the weak purchasing power, poor availability of imported goods, and stagnant salaries for civil servants.

Supply and transportation of goods to markets remained stable; however, an increase in transportation costs has been observed in all surveyed districts.

Soaring food and fuel prices are being further impacted by regional supply chain disruptions linked to the conflict in Ukraine. TIn 2022, the Pakistan rupees value decreased by 32 percent, classifying it as the second worst performing currency in the world (ranking below the Sri Lankan currency whose value decreased 78.4 percent this year) According to Arif Habib securities, the US dollar has increased 12.06 percent in value relative to the Pakistani rupee in July alone. The resultant economic impact is hitting the poorest segments of the economy the most. Headline inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased in May 2022 by 13.76 percent over May 2021. CPI food inflation in May 2022 increased by 17.3 percent over May 2021. (Further information is available in the Market Monitor Report for June 2022). \n<br><br>\nAccording to the results of the Comprehensive Food Security and Livelihood Assessment (CFSLA) in the newly merged areas of KP, overall 35 percent of the households are experiencing food insecurity. Of these, 31 percent are moderately food insecure while 4 percent are severely food insecure. \n<br><br>\nExperts fear that the country\u2019s wheat production may fall short of the 30 million tonnes required. As yet, the outlook provided by the Ministry of Agriculture remains positive, indicating nearly adequate availability of food to meet the country\u2019s need. However, against a backdrop of high levels of food security and undernutrition, weak food systems, high likelihood of flooding due to the ongoing monsoon season (as there have been localized instances of flooding, and resultant infrastructure damage at several locations across the country already) and significant disparities in the access and availability of food, there are serious concerns, particularly for poor and marginalized population groups.",

Rising food prices have also devalued cash disbursements being made under WFP\u2019s CBT programmes. The cost of WFP\u2019s food basket has also increased by 30 percent since January 2022.\n<br><br>\nWhile WFP in Pakistan rarely needs to import wheat internationally for its operations, the expected shortage could lead to a need for further wheat imports. The substantial hike in global wheat prices could have implications for WFP\u2019s food basket in Pakistan as well.\n<br><br>\nTo complement and support government social safety net programmes WFP will continue to provide livelihoods and community stabilization assistance for extremely vulnerable groups whose conditions are exacerbated by the adverse effect of soaring prices and a fragile socio-economic environment. This will be through cash or food distributions, complemented by community-based participatory activities \u2013 particularly livelihoods and resilience-building support. Assistance will be provided to participants of community rehabilitation activities and capacity strengthening trainings (persons with disabilities and other extremely vulnerable individuals will receive unconditional cash support).

The monthly transfer amount was increased in March 2022. The target group is steadily increasing; at the end of 2021 the programme covered 5.7 million beneficiaries, a figure that has now increased to 7.3 million, and the Government has earmarked budget for 9 million people for 2022-2023. To further protect against the fuel price hikes, the Government has announced a petrol and diesel subsidy of PKR 28 billion (US$ 136 million) in the fiscal budget 2022-23 for those vulnerable households earning less than PKR 40,000 a month. The current BISP beneficiaries of the Kafalat programme (7.3 million) would automatically receive this top-up amount of PKR 2,000 (US$ 9.7) each month under this support. \n<br><br>\nIn order to protect current development gains and prevent more people from being pushed into chronic food insecurity status, WFP is continuing engagement with the National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER) to incorporate the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) information into targeting and programming for the BISP.

Multiple factors are colliding to amplify the pressure, from unfavourable harvests (the most recent rice harvest is 50 percent lower than normal) and widespread shortages of key imported commodities (200 essential medicines are out of stock and fuel stocks have prompted closures\/suspension of schools and some government offices) to extremely volatile prices.

                "Bangladesh was the third major export market for both Russian and Ukrainian wheat in 2020-21, importing 1.51 million mt of wheat from Ukraine and 1.94 million mt from Russia. On 13 May, India then banned domestic exports of wheat and onion seeds, which \u2013 on top of the conflict \u2013 have sent local market prices spiralling upwards in Cox\u2019s Bazar. Before Indonesia temporarily banned the export of palm oil, 80 percent of Bangladeshi palm oil imports were sourced from Indonesia. \n<br><br>\nThe annual inflation rate in Bangladesh shot up to 7.56 percent in June of  2022 from 7.42 percent in the previous month. It was the highest inflation rate since July of 2013 underpinned by soaring prices of food (8.37 percent vs 8.30 percent in May). Refugees already spend an average of 52 percent of their e-voucher entitlement on rice. If their current purchasing power is not maintained, WFP expects to see refugees spend a higher proportion of their entitlement on energy-dense cereals to minimize food costs, as opposed to micronutrient-rich fresh fruits, vegetables, and animal proteins. ",
                "Inflation in Bangladesh in June rose to 7.56 per cent\u2014the highest in eight years. Adjusting the existing food monthly expenditure basket (MEB) for the April rate of inflation means an increase from USD 15.50 per person (established in November 2020) to USD 16.67per person. The rising cost of wheat will likely increase the cost of WSB+\/WSB++ and will require WFP to either reduce the ration size or reduce the number of participants in its nutrition programmes, unless additional donor support is secured. In May 2022, WFP had to abruptly provide a mid-month top-up to refugee households in the camps, due to a sudden nation-wide price hike in vegetable oil.\n<br><br>\nWFP is exploring the deployment of various solutions (individually or in parallel) to protect refugees\u2019 purchasing power in Cox\u2019s Bazar as much as possible, including: 1) Increase transfer value, where possible; 2) Deduct at-risk item(s) from value voucher and distribute directly to refugees (e.g., 1L of oil per person per month); 3) Maintain the same prices for refugees at outlet-level, but WFP to pay the market price difference to retailers directly; 4) Increase market research capacity to forecast at-risk items in advance (where possible) to provide more lead time to temporarily switch to in-kind, where necessary; 5) Assess the viability of alternative commodities to at-risk items, while maintaining nutritional value.",

Rising food prices and inflation are negatively affecting the ability of the poorest households, who already spend more than half of their budget on food, to access a nutritious diet. Poverty has skyrocketed from 20 percent in 2019 to 33 percent in 2021, with an additional 10 percent at risk of poverty. Extreme (food) poverty reached 6 percent in 2021 from 0.5 percent in 2019. Thus, two decades of development gains had been lost in just the two years before the current Global Food Crisis. Overall, the situation remains highly volatile as many unknowns remain on future developments.\n<br><br>\nIn June 2022, inflation remained high at 13.1 percent compared with June 2021, the highest in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries, and food inflation for staple commodities is nearing 20 percent (Jan-Jun 2022 compared with the same period last year). While fuel prices appeared to remain somewhat constant between February 2022 to June 2022, they remain over 60 percent higher than in February 2020. The Kyrgyz Republic does not produce mineral fertilizers and it imports it from Uzbekistan, the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Rising input costs (e.g., fertilizers) could impact next season\u2019s harvest, leading to elevated food prices in the longer run. Moreover, the Kyrgyz Republic has a high dependency on imports: 30 percent for wheat, 84 percent for vegetable oil and 37 percent for sugar. Out of the imported wheat, vegetable oil and sugar, 95 percent, 81 percent and 99 percent respectively comes from the Russian Federation. The high dependency on Russian imports exposes the country to increased vulnerability to shocks and volatility.\n<br><br>\nAdditionally, the Kyrgyz economy is highly dependent on remittances, which made up 31 percent of the country\u2019s economy (GDP) in 2020 and has been an important contributor to reducing the national poverty rate: without remittances, poverty would have reached 43 percent  and extreme poverty would have reached 17 percent in 2021. Remittances from the Russian Federation make up 80 percent of all remittances to the country. Due to the recent sanctions on the Russian Federation, a drop of 33 percent in remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic is predicted for 2022 (World Bank). Poverty may reach 38 percent at the end of 2022 (World Bank Estimate) due to the current crisis, increasing the already high social protection caseload. The proportion of the population who are food insecure is likely to be much higher, since those below the poverty line cannot afford a nutrient adequate diet.",

About two in five households reported that their income has been cut in half.\n<br><br>\nSeveral events (not all directly related to Ukraine) led to food inflation skyrocketing to 80 percent in June 2022, driven by rising global food prices, a dwindling currency, and low domestic food production. Multiple factors are colliding to amplify the pressure, from unfavourable harvests (the most recent rice harvest is 50 percent lower than normal) and widespread shortages of key imported commodities (200 essential medicines are out of stock and fuel stocks have prompted closures\/suspension of schools and some government offices) to extremely volatile prices.

                "The conflict is exacerbating existing stresses following the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which had already eroded the resilience of the most vulnerable households. Rising food prices and inflation are negatively affecting the ability of the poorest households, who already spend more than half of their budget on food, to access a nutritious diet. Poverty has skyrocketed from 20 percent in 2019 to 33 percent in 2021, with an additional 10 percent at risk of poverty. Extreme (food) poverty reached 6 percent in 2021 from 0.5 percent in 2019. Thus, two decades of development gains had been lost in just the two years before the current Global Food Crisis. Overall, the situation remains highly volatile as many unknowns remain on future developments.\n<br><br>\nIn June 2022, inflation remained high at 13.1 percent compared with June 2021, the highest in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries, and food inflation for staple commodities is nearing 20 percent (Jan-Jun 2022 compared with the same period last year). While fuel prices appeared to remain somewhat constant between February 2022 to June 2022, they remain over 60 percent higher than in February 2020. The Kyrgyz Republic does not produce mineral fertilizers and it imports it from Uzbekistan, the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Rising input costs (e.g., fertilizers) could impact next season\u2019s harvest, leading to elevated food prices in the longer run. Moreover, the Kyrgyz Republic has a high dependency on imports: 30 percent for wheat, 84 percent for vegetable oil and 37 percent for sugar. Out of the imported wheat, vegetable oil and sugar, 95 percent, 81 percent and 99 percent respectively comes from the Russian Federation. The high dependency on Russian imports exposes the country to increased vulnerability to shocks and volatility.\n<br><br>\nAdditionally, the Kyrgyz economy is highly dependent on remittances, which made up 31 percent of the country\u2019s economy (GDP) in 2020 and has been an important contributor to reducing the national poverty rate: without remittances, poverty would have reached 43 percent  and extreme poverty would have reached 17 percent in 2021. Remittances from the Russian Federation make up 80 percent of all remittances to the country. Due to the recent sanctions on the Russian Federation, a drop of 33 percent in remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic is predicted for 2022 (World Bank). Poverty may reach 38 percent at the end of 2022 (World Bank Estimate) due to the current crisis, increasing the already high social protection caseload. The proportion of the population who are food insecure is likely to be much higher, since those below the poverty line cannot afford a nutrient adequate diet.",

                "While Nepal\u2019s direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine is largely limited, rising food and fuel prices, export bans, and supply chain limitations for cereals, vegetable oils and fertilizers could negatively impact food supply and ultimately push food even further out of reach for the most vulnerable people. \n<br><br>\nIn June 2022, compared to the previous year, prices of essential commodities showed an upward trend, increasing pressure on vulnerable households. Prices of edible oil, wheat flour and pulses increased sharply. The inflation rate rose to 8.56 percent in June 2022, year-on-year. Overall, the increases can be largely explained by the impact of the conflict in Ukraine on Nepal\u2019s retail markets, the shortage of some food commodities, and the increase in fuel prices and transportation costs. Supply and transportation of goods to markets remained stable; however, an increase in transportation costs has been observed in all surveyed districts. Export bans imposed by India, including on wheat and sugar, are also increasing prices and having knock-on effects, for example on the cost of poultry and eggs. The early and above average 2022 monsoon season will also likely contribute to increased food insecurity along with rising prices.",
                "Immediate impacts on WFP operations will include delays in procurement and increases in the cost of operations, constraining WFP\u2019s ability to respond.

                "Pakistan is facing a growing debt crisis exacerbated by chronic trade imbalances. Soaring food and fuel prices are being further impacted by regional supply chain disruptions linked to the conflict in Ukraine. TIn 2022, the Pakistan rupees value decreased by 32 percent, classifying it as the second worst performing currency in the world (ranking below the Sri Lankan currency whose value decreased 78.4 percent this year) According to Arif Habib securities, the US dollar has increased 12.06 percent in value relative to the Pakistani rupee in July alone. The resultant economic impact is hitting the poorest segments of the economy the most. Headline inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased in May 2022 by 13.76 percent over May 2021. CPI food inflation in May 2022 increased by 17.3 percent over May 2021. (Further information is available in the Market Monitor Report for June 2022). \n<br><br>\nAccording to the results of the Comprehensive Food Security and Livelihood Assessment (CFSLA) in the newly merged areas of KP, overall 35 percent of the households are experiencing food insecurity. Of these, 31 percent are moderately food insecure while 4 percent are severely food insecure. \n<br><br>\nExperts fear that the country\u2019s wheat production may fall short of the 30 million tonnes required. As yet, the outlook provided by the Ministry of Agriculture remains positive, indicating nearly adequate availability of food to meet the country\u2019s need. However, against a backdrop of high levels of food security and undernutrition, weak food systems, high likelihood of flooding due to the ongoing monsoon season (as there have been localized instances of flooding, and resultant infrastructure damage at several locations across the country already) and significant disparities in the access and availability of food, there are serious concerns, particularly for poor and marginalized population groups.",
                "The crisis has led to supply disruptions, which have seriously impacted the availability of fortified vegetable oil for WFP\u2019s standard food basket, and in some cases, oil will not be distributed along with the food rations (thereby resulting in a decline in its caloric and monetary value). Rising food prices have also devalued cash disbursements being made under WFP\u2019s CBT programmes. The cost of WFP\u2019s food basket has also increased by 30 percent since January 2022.\n<br><br>\nWhile WFP in Pakistan rarely needs to import wheat internationally for its operations, the expected shortage could lead to a need for further wheat imports. The substantial hike in global wheat prices could have implications for WFP\u2019s food basket in Pakistan as well.\n<br><br>\nTo complement and support government social safety net programmes WFP will continue to provide livelihoods and community stabilization assistance for extremely vulnerable groups whose conditions are exacerbated by the adverse effect of soaring prices and a fragile socio-economic environment. This will be through cash or food distributions, complemented by community-based participatory activities \u2013 particularly livelihoods and resilience-building support. Assistance will be provided to participants of community rehabilitation activities and capacity strengthening trainings (persons with disabilities and other extremely vulnerable individuals will receive unconditional cash support). ",
                "The BISP Kafalat social safety net programme of the Government of Pakistan currently covers 7.3 million people with a monthly stipend of PKR 2,000 per household. The monthly transfer amount was increased in March 2022. The target group is steadily increasing; at the end of 2021 the programme covered 5.7 million beneficiaries, a figure that has now increased to 7.3 million, and the Government has earmarked budget for 9 million people for 2022-2023. To further protect against the fuel price hikes, the Government has announced a petrol and diesel subsidy of PKR 28 billion (US$ 136 million) in the fiscal budget 2022-23 for those vulnerable households earning less than PKR 40,000 a month. The current BISP beneficiaries of the Kafalat programme (7.3 million) would automatically receive this top-up amount of PKR 2,000 (US$ 9.7) each month under this support. \n<br><br>\nIn order to protect current development gains and prevent more people from being pushed into chronic food insecurity status, WFP is continuing engagement with the National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER) to incorporate the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) information into targeting and programming for the BISP. This will maximize the prospects of inclusion for the most affected and vulnerable families for support, thereby circumventing a further deterioration in their food and nutrition security.",

Multiple factors are colliding to amplify the pressure, from unfavourable harvests (the most recent rice harvest is 50 percent lower than normal) and widespread shortages of key imported commodities (200 essential medicines are out of stock and fuel stocks have prompted closures\/suspension of schools and some government offices) to extremely volatile prices.

In June, supply of wheat to Afghan markets dropped by 49 percent, compared to the previous month, mainly due to export restrictions from Kazakhstan, which acts as the primary supplier of wheat to the country. Kazakhstan\u2019s recent extension of export restrictions through September 2022 indicates that supply challenges for staple food commodities in Afghanistan will continue into the second half of 2022. Due to the impact of the war in Ukraine on global supply chains, WFP continues to struggle with long lead times for the delivery of international procured commodities to Afghanistan.

On 13 May, India then banned domestic exports of wheat and onion seeds, which \u2013 on top of the conflict \u2013 have sent local market prices spiralling upwards in Cox\u2019s Bazar.

It was the highest inflation rate since July of 2013 underpinned by soaring prices of food (8.37 percent vs 8.30 percent in May). Refugees already spend an average of 52 percent of their e-voucher entitlement on rice. If their current purchasing power is not maintained, WFP expects to see refugees spend a higher proportion of their entitlement on energy-dense cereals to minimize food costs, as opposed to micronutrient-rich fresh fruits, vegetables, and animal proteins.

Adjusting the existing food monthly expenditure basket (MEB) for the April rate of inflation means an increase from USD 15.50 per person (established in November 2020) to USD 16.67per person. The rising cost of wheat will likely increase the cost of WSB+\/WSB++ and will require WFP to either reduce the ration size or reduce the number of participants in its nutrition programmes, unless additional donor support is secured. In May 2022, WFP had to abruptly provide a mid-month top-up to refugee households in the camps, due to a sudden nation-wide price hike in vegetable oil.\n<br><br>\nWFP is exploring the deployment of various solutions (individually or in parallel) to protect refugees\u2019 purchasing power in Cox\u2019s Bazar as much as possible, including: 1) Increase transfer value, where possible; 2) Deduct at-risk item(s) from value voucher and distribute directly to refugees (e.g., 1L of oil per person per month); 3) Maintain the same prices for refugees at outlet-level, but WFP to pay the market price difference to retailers directly; 4) Increase market research capacity to forecast at-risk items in advance (where possible) to provide more lead time to temporarily switch to in-kind, where necessary; 5) Assess the viability of alternative commodities to at-risk items, while maintaining nutritional value.",

                "The conflict is exacerbating existing stresses following the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which had already eroded the resilience of the most vulnerable households. Rising food prices and inflation are negatively affecting the ability of the poorest households, who already spend more than half of their budget on food, to access a nutritious diet. Poverty has skyrocketed from 20 percent in 2019 to 33 percent in 2021, with an additional 10 percent at risk of poverty. Extreme (food) poverty reached 6 percent in 2021 from 0.5 percent in 2019. Thus, two decades of development gains had been lost in just the two years before the current Global Food Crisis. Overall, the situation remains highly volatile as many unknowns remain on future developments.\n<br><br>\nIn June 2022, inflation remained high at 13.1 percent compared with June 2021, the highest in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries, and food inflation for staple commodities is nearing 20 percent (Jan-Jun 2022 compared with the same period last year). While fuel prices appeared to remain somewhat constant between February 2022 to June 2022, they remain over 60 percent higher than in February 2020. The Kyrgyz Republic does not produce mineral fertilizers and it imports it from Uzbekistan, the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Rising input costs (e.g., fertilizers) could impact next season\u2019s harvest, leading to elevated food prices in the longer run. Moreover, the Kyrgyz Republic has a high dependency on imports: 30 percent for wheat, 84 percent for vegetable oil and 37 percent for sugar. Out of the imported wheat, vegetable oil and sugar, 95 percent, 81 percent and 99 percent respectively comes from the Russian Federation. The high dependency on Russian imports exposes the country to increased vulnerability to shocks and volatility.\n<br><br>\nAdditionally, the Kyrgyz economy is highly dependent on remittances, which made up 31 percent of the country\u2019s economy (GDP) in 2020 and has been an important contributor to reducing the national poverty rate: without remittances, poverty would have reached 43 percent  and extreme poverty would have reached 17 percent in 2021. Remittances from the Russian Federation make up 80 percent of all remittances to the country. Due to the recent sanctions on the Russian Federation, a drop of 33 percent in remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic is predicted for 2022 (World Bank). Poverty may reach 38 percent at the end of 2022 (World Bank Estimate) due to the current crisis, increasing the already high social protection caseload. The proportion of the population who are food insecure is likely to be much higher, since those below the poverty line cannot afford a nutrient adequate diet.",
                "WFP is preparing to expand its beneficiary base as the food security situation worsens.

Under the Optimisation of the School Meals Programme (Outcome 1), this may include increasing advocacy for government contributions to be adjusted against inflation or another index (i.e., indexation of contributions) and formalizing parental contributions. \n<br><br>\nThe country office, in collaboration with UNDP, FAO and UNICEF, will conduct a household survey on the impact of the crisis on households to assess their food security and resilience among others. WFP will continue regular market price monitoring for key commodities and, from August 2022, household primary data collection (mVAM) to assess the vulnerability and food security impact of the crisis.\n<br><br>\nUnder WFP\u2019s food assistance for assets and food assistance for training activities, WFP is prioritizing assets and trainings with clear and direct linkages to improved food security.

In addition, during this period households are likely to experience some deterioration\n in their diets and food security that is normally associated with the lean season.  This has serious implications on the food security situation of some households because of the weak purchasing power, poor availability of imported goods, and stagnant salaries for civil servants. In addition, the record depreciation of the Lao Kip against the US dollar and the Thai baht are exacerbating inflation levels in Lao PDR and exposing some households to weak purchasing power, ultimately impacting the quality and quantity of households\u2019 diets.

The Cluster has advised partners to expect an increase in costs of up to 40 percent and to budget accordingly. Cluster leads are also concerned that rising costs will increase activity support costs, which will require budget adjustments that may have a negative impact on the number of beneficiaries reached in 2022.

The substantial hike in global wheat prices could have implications for WFP\u2019s food basket in Pakistan as well.\n<br><br>\nTo complement and support government social safety net programmes WFP will continue to provide livelihoods and community stabilization assistance for extremely vulnerable groups whose conditions are exacerbated by the adverse effect of soaring prices and a fragile socio-economic environment. This will be through cash or food distributions, complemented by community-based participatory activities \u2013 particularly livelihoods and resilience-building support. Assistance will be provided to participants of community rehabilitation activities and capacity strengthening trainings (persons with disabilities and other extremely vulnerable individuals will receive unconditional cash support).

                "The BISP Kafalat social safety net programme of the Government of Pakistan currently covers 7.3 million people with a monthly stipend of PKR 2,000 per household. The monthly transfer amount was increased in March 2022. The target group is steadily increasing; at the end of 2021 the programme covered 5.7 million beneficiaries, a figure that has now increased to 7.3 million, and the Government has earmarked budget for 9 million people for 2022-2023. To further protect against the fuel price hikes, the Government has announced a petrol and diesel subsidy of PKR 28 billion (US$ 136 million) in the fiscal budget 2022-23 for those vulnerable households earning less than PKR 40,000 a month. The current BISP beneficiaries of the Kafalat programme (7.3 million) would automatically receive this top-up amount of PKR 2,000 (US$ 9.7) each month under this support. \n<br><br>\nIn order to protect current development gains and prevent more people from being pushed into chronic food insecurity status, WFP is continuing engagement with the National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER) to incorporate the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) information into targeting and programming for the BISP. This will maximize the prospects of inclusion for the most affected and vulnerable families for support, thereby circumventing a further deterioration in their food and nutrition security.",

Multiple factors are colliding to amplify the pressure, from unfavourable harvests (the most recent rice harvest is 50 percent lower than normal) and widespread shortages of key imported commodities (200 essential medicines are out of stock and fuel stocks have prompted closures\/suspension of schools and some government offices) to extremely volatile prices.

The rising cost of wheat will likely increase the cost of WSB+\/WSB++ and will require WFP to either reduce the ration size or reduce the number of participants in its nutrition programmes, unless additional donor support is secured.

Rising food prices and inflation are negatively affecting the ability of the poorest households, who already spend more than half of their budget on food, to access a nutritious diet. Poverty has skyrocketed from 20 percent in 2019 to 33 percent in 2021, with an additional 10 percent at risk of poverty. Extreme (food) poverty reached 6 percent in 2021 from 0.5 percent in 2019. Thus, two decades of development gains had been lost in just the two years before the current Global Food Crisis. Overall, the situation remains highly volatile as many unknowns remain on future developments.\n<br><br>\nIn June 2022, inflation remained high at 13.1 percent compared with June 2021, the highest in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries, and food inflation for staple commodities is nearing 20 percent (Jan-Jun 2022 compared with the same period last year). While fuel prices appeared to remain somewhat constant between February 2022 to June 2022, they remain over 60 percent higher than in February 2020. The Kyrgyz Republic does not produce mineral fertilizers and it imports it from Uzbekistan, the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Rising input costs (e.g., fertilizers) could impact next season\u2019s harvest, leading to elevated food prices in the longer run. Moreover, the Kyrgyz Republic has a high dependency on imports: 30 percent for wheat, 84 percent for vegetable oil and 37 percent for sugar. Out of the imported wheat, vegetable oil and sugar, 95 percent, 81 percent and 99 percent respectively comes from the Russian Federation. The high dependency on Russian imports exposes the country to increased vulnerability to shocks and volatility.\n<br><br>\nAdditionally, the Kyrgyz economy is highly dependent on remittances, which made up 31 percent of the country\u2019s economy (GDP) in 2020 and has been an important contributor to reducing the national poverty rate: without remittances, poverty would have reached 43 percent  and extreme poverty would have reached 17 percent in 2021. Remittances from the Russian Federation make up 80 percent of all remittances to the country. Due to the recent sanctions on the Russian Federation, a drop of 33 percent in remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic is predicted for 2022 (World Bank). Poverty may reach 38 percent at the end of 2022 (World Bank Estimate) due to the current crisis, increasing the already high social protection caseload. The proportion of the population who are food insecure is likely to be much higher, since those below the poverty line cannot afford a nutrient adequate diet.",

The Cluster has advised partners to expect an increase in costs of up to 40 percent and to budget accordingly. Cluster leads are also concerned that rising costs will increase activity support costs, which will require budget adjustments that may have a negative impact on the number of beneficiaries reached in 2022. Further, with the Humanitarian Response Plan critically underfunded in 2022, Cluster partners may have to reduce staff numbers.

Supply and transportation of goods to markets remained stable; however, an increase in transportation costs has been observed in all surveyed districts.

June\u2019s figure shows an increase from the 3.55 percent recorded in May and is exceeding the 4 percent target set by the Government but remains lower than the rest of the world \u2013 indicating overall good economic performance so far, according to the International Monetary Fund. The rise in inflation was mainly triggered by volatile prices of food commodities including chilli, bird\u2019s eye chilli, shallot, and chicken egg. The increase in domestic prices was mainly caused by crop failures due to a rainfall anomaly. \n<br><br>\nThe domestic price of wheat flour in Indonesia has recorded a consistent increase since the start of the conflict in Ukraine. When comparing the third week of February with the fourth week of July, the price of domestic wheat flour recorded a 12 percent weekly increase. Despite this, the knock-on effects of the conflict in Ukraine on Indonesia have been minimal to date, as Indonesia has substituted wheat imports from Ukraine. In June, Indonesia doubled its imports from Australia and has also started importing wheat from other countries including Argentina, Thailand, Pakistan, and Myanmar. Moreover, on the domestic market, imports of wheat are used for the wheat flour industry, instant noodles, bread, and cattle feed which are not considered staple commodities in Indonesia. ",

                "The conflict is exacerbating existing stresses following the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which had already eroded the resilience of the most vulnerable households. Rising food prices and inflation are negatively affecting the ability of the poorest households, who already spend more than half of their budget on food, to access a nutritious diet. Poverty has skyrocketed from 20 percent in 2019 to 33 percent in 2021, with an additional 10 percent at risk of poverty. Extreme (food) poverty reached 6 percent in 2021 from 0.5 percent in 2019. Thus, two decades of development gains had been lost in just the two years before the current Global Food Crisis. Overall, the situation remains highly volatile as many unknowns remain on future developments.\n<br><br>\nIn June 2022, inflation remained high at 13.1 percent compared with June 2021, the highest in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries, and food inflation for staple commodities is nearing 20 percent (Jan-Jun 2022 compared with the same period last year). While fuel prices appeared to remain somewhat constant between February 2022 to June 2022, they remain over 60 percent higher than in February 2020. The Kyrgyz Republic does not produce mineral fertilizers and it imports it from Uzbekistan, the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Rising input costs (e.g., fertilizers) could impact next season\u2019s harvest, leading to elevated food prices in the longer run. Moreover, the Kyrgyz Republic has a high dependency on imports: 30 percent for wheat, 84 percent for vegetable oil and 37 percent for sugar. Out of the imported wheat, vegetable oil and sugar, 95 percent, 81 percent and 99 percent respectively comes from the Russian Federation. The high dependency on Russian imports exposes the country to increased vulnerability to shocks and volatility.\n<br><br>\nAdditionally, the Kyrgyz economy is highly dependent on remittances, which made up 31 percent of the country\u2019s economy (GDP) in 2020 and has been an important contributor to reducing the national poverty rate: without remittances, poverty would have reached 43 percent  and extreme poverty would have reached 17 percent in 2021. Remittances from the Russian Federation make up 80 percent of all remittances to the country. Due to the recent sanctions on the Russian Federation, a drop of 33 percent in remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic is predicted for 2022 (World Bank). Poverty may reach 38 percent at the end of 2022 (World Bank Estimate) due to the current crisis, increasing the already high social protection caseload. The proportion of the population who are food insecure is likely to be much higher, since those below the poverty line cannot afford a nutrient adequate diet.",

Under the Optimisation of the School Meals Programme (Outcome 1), this may include increasing advocacy for government contributions to be adjusted against inflation or another index (i.e., indexation of contributions) and formalizing parental contributions. \n<br><br>\nThe country office, in collaboration with UNDP, FAO and UNICEF, will conduct a household survey on the impact of the crisis on households to assess their food security and resilience among others. WFP will continue regular market price monitoring for key commodities and, from August 2022, household primary data collection (mVAM) to assess the vulnerability and food security impact of the crisis.\n<br><br>\nUnder WFP\u2019s food assistance for assets and food assistance for training activities, WFP is prioritizing assets and trainings with clear and direct linkages to improved food security. WFP will also review its transfer entitlements through conditional transfer such as FFA and FFT, based on the situation. Improvement of agricultural infrastructure, resilient food systems, creating income opportunities, and vocational training will be enhanced.

Prices of edible oil, wheat flour and pulses increased sharply. The inflation rate rose to 8.56 percent in June 2022, year-on-year. Overall, the increases can be largely explained by the impact of the conflict in Ukraine on Nepal\u2019s retail markets, the shortage of some food commodities, and the increase in fuel prices and transportation costs. Supply and transportation of goods to markets remained stable; however, an increase in transportation costs has been observed in all surveyed districts.

The price volatility for countries\u2019 goods and services could largely be due to other factors such as commodity markets, policy changes or seasonal or infrequent price setting as experienced by the supply chain globally. Rising farm inputs such as fertilizers will most likely impact the next season\u2019s harvest, which could also lead to increases in food prices in the longer term.

The resultant economic impact is hitting the poorest segments of the economy the most. Headline inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased in May 2022 by 13.76 percent over May 2021. CPI food inflation in May 2022 increased by 17.3 percent over May 2021.

As yet, the outlook provided by the Ministry of Agriculture remains positive, indicating nearly adequate availability of food to meet the country\u2019s need. However, against a backdrop of high levels of food security and undernutrition, weak food systems, high likelihood of flooding due to the ongoing monsoon season (as there have been localized instances of flooding, and resultant infrastructure damage at several locations across the country already) and significant disparities in the access and availability of food, there are serious concerns, particularly for poor and marginalized population groups.",

Rising food prices have also devalued cash disbursements being made under WFP\u2019s CBT programmes. The cost of WFP\u2019s food basket has also increased by 30 percent since January 2022.\n<br><br>\nWhile WFP in Pakistan rarely needs to import wheat internationally for its operations, the expected shortage could lead to a need for further wheat imports. The substantial hike in global wheat prices could have implications for WFP\u2019s food basket in Pakistan as well.\n<br><br>\nTo complement and support government social safety net programmes WFP will continue to provide livelihoods and community stabilization assistance for extremely vulnerable groups whose conditions are exacerbated by the adverse effect of soaring prices and a fragile socio-economic environment. This will be through cash or food distributions, complemented by community-based participatory activities \u2013 particularly livelihoods and resilience-building support.

Multiple factors are colliding to amplify the pressure, from unfavourable harvests (the most recent rice harvest is 50 percent lower than normal) and widespread shortages of key imported commodities (200 essential medicines are out of stock and fuel stocks have prompted closures\/suspension of schools and some government offices) to extremely volatile prices.

                "Bangladesh was the third major export market for both Russian and Ukrainian wheat in 2020-21, importing 1.51 million mt of wheat from Ukraine and 1.94 million mt from Russia. On 13 May, India then banned domestic exports of wheat and onion seeds, which \u2013 on top of the conflict \u2013 have sent local market prices spiralling upwards in Cox\u2019s Bazar. Before Indonesia temporarily banned the export of palm oil, 80 percent of Bangladeshi palm oil imports were sourced from Indonesia. \n<br><br>\nThe annual inflation rate in Bangladesh shot up to 7.56 percent in June of  2022 from 7.42 percent in the previous month. It was the highest inflation rate since July of 2013 underpinned by soaring prices of food (8.37 percent vs 8.30 percent in May). Refugees already spend an average of 52 percent of their e-voucher entitlement on rice. If their current purchasing power is not maintained, WFP expects to see refugees spend a higher proportion of their entitlement on energy-dense cereals to minimize food costs, as opposed to micronutrient-rich fresh fruits, vegetables, and animal proteins. ",
                "Inflation in Bangladesh in June rose to 7.56 per cent\u2014the highest in eight years. Adjusting the existing food monthly expenditure basket (MEB) for the April rate of inflation means an increase from USD 15.50 per person (established in November 2020) to USD 16.67per person. The rising cost of wheat will likely increase the cost of WSB+\/WSB++ and will require WFP to either reduce the ration size or reduce the number of participants in its nutrition programmes, unless additional donor support is secured. In May 2022, WFP had to abruptly provide a mid-month top-up to refugee households in the camps, due to a sudden nation-wide price hike in vegetable oil.\n<br><br>\nWFP is exploring the deployment of various solutions (individually or in parallel) to protect refugees\u2019 purchasing power in Cox\u2019s Bazar as much as possible, including: 1) Increase transfer value, where possible; 2) Deduct at-risk item(s) from value voucher and distribute directly to refugees (e.g., 1L of oil per person per month); 3) Maintain the same prices for refugees at outlet-level, but WFP to pay the market price difference to retailers directly; 4) Increase market research capacity to forecast at-risk items in advance (where possible) to provide more lead time to temporarily switch to in-kind, where necessary; 5) Assess the viability of alternative commodities to at-risk items, while maintaining nutritional value.",

Rising food prices and inflation are negatively affecting the ability of the poorest households, who already spend more than half of their budget on food, to access a nutritious diet. Poverty has skyrocketed from 20 percent in 2019 to 33 percent in 2021, with an additional 10 percent at risk of poverty. Extreme (food) poverty reached 6 percent in 2021 from 0.5 percent in 2019. Thus, two decades of development gains had been lost in just the two years before the current Global Food Crisis. Overall, the situation remains highly volatile as many unknowns remain on future developments.\n<br><br>\nIn June 2022, inflation remained high at 13.1 percent compared with June 2021, the highest in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries, and food inflation for staple commodities is nearing 20 percent (Jan-Jun 2022 compared with the same period last year). While fuel prices appeared to remain somewhat constant between February 2022 to June 2022, they remain over 60 percent higher than in February 2020. The Kyrgyz Republic does not produce mineral fertilizers and it imports it from Uzbekistan, the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Rising input costs (e.g., fertilizers) could impact next season\u2019s harvest, leading to elevated food prices in the longer run. Moreover, the Kyrgyz Republic has a high dependency on imports: 30 percent for wheat, 84 percent for vegetable oil and 37 percent for sugar. Out of the imported wheat, vegetable oil and sugar, 95 percent, 81 percent and 99 percent respectively comes from the Russian Federation. The high dependency on Russian imports exposes the country to increased vulnerability to shocks and volatility.\n<br><br>\nAdditionally, the Kyrgyz economy is highly dependent on remittances, which made up 31 percent of the country\u2019s economy (GDP) in 2020 and has been an important contributor to reducing the national poverty rate: without remittances, poverty would have reached 43 percent  and extreme poverty would have reached 17 percent in 2021. Remittances from the Russian Federation make up 80 percent of all remittances to the country. Due to the recent sanctions on the Russian Federation, a drop of 33 percent in remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic is predicted for 2022 (World Bank). Poverty may reach 38 percent at the end of 2022 (World Bank Estimate) due to the current crisis, increasing the already high social protection caseload. The proportion of the population who are food insecure is likely to be much higher, since those below the poverty line cannot afford a nutrient adequate diet.",

WFP is concerned that these figures could increase drastically without immediate intervention and that the crisis\u2019 impact will be felt beyond 2022. Skyrocketing food costs are making it harder for the population to meet their food needs. About 6.7 million people are not consuming adequate diets and 5.3 million people are reducing the number of meals eaten. Incomes in the last three months have plummeted. About two in five households reported that their income has been cut in half.\n<br><br>\nSeveral events (not all directly related to Ukraine) led to food inflation skyrocketing to 80 percent in June 2022, driven by rising global food prices, a dwindling currency, and low domestic food production. Multiple factors are colliding to amplify the pressure, from unfavourable harvests (the most recent rice harvest is 50 percent lower than normal) and widespread shortages of key imported commodities (200 essential medicines are out of stock and fuel stocks have prompted closures\/suspension of schools and some government offices) to extremely volatile prices.
